Strange Pair
A pair of strings form a strange pair if both of the following are true:

The 1st string's first letter = 2nd string's last letter.
The 1st string's last letter = 2nd string's first letter.
Create a function that returns true if a pair of strings constitutes a strange pair, and false otherwise.
